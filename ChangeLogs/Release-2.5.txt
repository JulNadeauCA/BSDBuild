Release Notes for BSDBuild 2.5 (Chatiment de la Rose)
-----------------------------------------------------
- Simplified project file generation; rewrite of mkprojfiles for proper
  parsing of makefile variables, removed ${PROJINCLUDES}.
- The ${DESTDIR} variable is now recognized. ${DESTDIR} is prepended to
  installation targets at "make install", for the convenience of ports
  systems with "fake" support.
- Added FabBSD (http://fabbsd.org/) to target platforms.
- New configure test: gettimeofday
- New tests for compiler attributes: aligned, const, deprecated,
  noreturn, pure, warn_unused_result.
- Updated cracklib test for repackaged version.
