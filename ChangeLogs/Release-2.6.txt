Release Notes for BSDBuild 2.6
------------------------------
- Implemented scanning of Makefiles for those requiring .depend files (from
  ./configure). This eliminates the need for keeping annoying empty .depend
  files on source code repositories.
- Added ${CONF} and ${CONFDIR} support to <build.lib.mk>.
- Added test for glob(3).
- Added test for syslog(2).
- Added test for Berkeley DB v4.
- Fixed unsafe defines in asprintf() and vasprintf() tests.
- Sync PerCGI test with latest version.
