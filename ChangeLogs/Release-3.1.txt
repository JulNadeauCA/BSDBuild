Release Notes for BSDBuild 3.1
------------------------------

- <build.man.mk>: Add support for OpenBSD's new mandoc(1). Add support
  for PDF and HTML output. Introduce new target: "make lint".
- Document build.man.mk(5), which ironically was missing its own manpage.
- <build.prog.mk>: Allow ${PROG_TYPE} dependent LDFLAGS to be defined.
- <build.lib.mk>: Updated bundled libtool to 2.4.2. switch to libtool's
  LIB_{CURRENT,REVISION,AGE} versioning scheme.
- <build.www.mk>: Multi-lingual document targets are now specified as ${HTML}
  elements with the .html.var extension (as opposed to the .html extension).
  charset variants are now written into ${CHARSETS} subdirectories.
- mkconfigure(1): To make generated scripts smaller, the "--cache" code is
  no longer included by default. The directive CONFIG_CACHE(yes) can be used
  to enable the "--cache" feature again. Produce config.status files.
- a few more ${DESTDIR} fixes; thanks bonsaikitten!
- Miscellaneous fixes and improvements to the manual pages.
- BSDBuild: Various fixes in the test modules. Some tweaks to handle recently
  introduced compiler warnings.
- cc/cxx/objc: When cross-compiling, try to autodetect ${host}-cc, et al.
- cxx/objc: Remove unneeded builtin tests for cygwin/long long/long double.
- sdl: On MacOS X, fallback to trying "-framework SDL" if `sdl-config` fails.
- sdl: On Windows, prefer linking to SDL.dll wherever possible.
- x11: Add /usr/local/include, /usr/include to fallback test. add test
  for XKB extension (HAVE_XKB)
- pthreads: Dragonfly doesn't require extra PTHREAD_XOPEN_CFLAGS;
  thanks varialus!
- getpwuid: Don't reference non-portable fields in test.
- portaudio: Only test for portaudio2.
- math_c99: Disable on *-pc-mingw32, to work around a bug in libmingwex
  causing linker errors if single-precision variants of the math routines
  (e.g., fabsf()) are used.
- opengl: On MacOS X, prefer "-framework OpenGL" to -lGL where available.
- jpeg: Remove _WIN32 exception (there are workarounds the <windows.h> issue).
- perl: Fix compiler warnings in test (due to myPerl -> my_perl).
- sse: Remove unnecessary test code.
- New tests: csidl, etubestore, freesg-rg, kqueue, nanosleep, rand48, timerfd,
  uim, xbox.
