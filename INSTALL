BSDBuild Installation
---------------------

To install BSDBuild onto your system, use the following:

	$ ./configure
	$ make depend all
	# make install

This will install mkconfigure(1) and mkify(1) on your system.

The mkify(1) utility is used to construct a BSDBuild "mk" directory
intended to be bundled with your application so that people building
it do not need to know at all about BSDBuild. See the mkify(1) manual
page for more details.

The mkconfigure(1) utility is used to generate a standard Bourne
"./configure" script from a configure.in file. See the mkconfigure(1)
manual page for more details.
