vedge-mk

This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
to most make variants which support the include directive, as an
alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
variables and the include directive at the bottom. It processes
directories recursively. The maptree.sh script substitutes %TOP%
to the top-level build directory, and creates default makefiles
if they are not present. It is only useful to the maintainer.
It takes the type of package an an argument, one of:

    lib	    A library (static and possibly shared).
    man	    Simple manual pages, requires nroff.
    prog    A program in C or C++.
    www	    HTML pages, requires M4.

The vedge-mk library should be installed as ./mk in the top-level
build directory, you don't need to bundle ./mk with your package.

vedge-www.mk

    The www library looks for a M4 template in $(BASE)/html.m4, $(BASE)
    defaulting to ./base. The M4 template includes base.htm. The files
    .htm are converted to .html, the .htm files being M4 files defining
    _TITLE_ and _CONTENT_. The quotes default to `{' and `}'.
