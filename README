vedge-mk

This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
to most make variants which support the include directive, as an
alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
variables and the include directive at the bottom. It processes
directories recursively. The maptree.sh script substitutes %TOP%
to the top-level build directory, and creates default makefiles
if they are not present. It is only useful to the maintainer.
It takes the type of package an an argument, one of:

    lib	    A library (build shared and static).
    man	    Simple manual pages, requires nroff.
    prog    A program in C or C++.
    www	    HTML pages, requires M4.

The vedge-mk library should be installed as ./mk in the top-level
build directory, you don't need to bundle ./mk with your package.
