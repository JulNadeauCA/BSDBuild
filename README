vedge-mk

This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
to most make variants which support the include directive, as an
alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
variables and the include directive at the bottom. It processes
directories recursively. The maptree.sh script substitutes %TOP%
to the top-level build directory, and creates default makefiles
if they are not present. It is only useful to the maintainer.

The vedge-mk library should be installed as ./mk in the top-level
build directory, it is required by the makefiles.
