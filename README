Csoft-mk
========

DESCRIPTION

    This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
    to most make variants which support the `include' directive, as
    an alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

    This makefile library is installed with the `mkify.pl' script.

MAKEFILES

    The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
    variables and the include directive at the bottom. Obviously we
    cannot rely on -I or system makefile includes, so each makefile
    must define the top-level directory, and include the appropriate
    include(s) at the end.

INCLUDES

    <csoft.lib.mk>
      The lib include can create static and shared libraries from ${OBJS}.
      For portability reasons, libtool is used for shared libraries, but
      static libraries are linked with ${AR}.

    <csoft.man.mk>
      The man include does man pages (${MANn}).

    <csoft.perl.mk>
      The perl include installs .pl .pm and .perl files in ${OBJS}.

    <csoft.prog.mk>
      The prog include makes .o and .so objects out of .c, .cc, .C,
      .cxx, .s and .asm files.

    <csoft.subdir.mk>
      This simply executes standard targets in ${SUBDIR} directories.

    <csoft.www.mk>
      The www include looks for a M4 template in ${BASE}/html.m4, ${BASE}
      defaulting to ./base. The M4 template includes base.htm; additional
      M4 include files should be in $(BASE). The M4 quotes default to `{'
      and `}'. This is compatible with both BSD and GNU M4.

      This system supports flavoring -- one .html file per template may
      be generated from a single .htm, with appropriate macro expansions.
