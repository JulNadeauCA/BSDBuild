Description

    This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
    to most make variants which support the `include' directive, as
    an alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

    This makefile library should be installed as ./mk in the top-level
    build directory.

Makefiles

    The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
    variables and the include directive at the bottom. Obviously we
    cannot rely on -I or system makefile includes, so each makefile
    must define the top-level directory, and include the appropriate
    include(s) at the end.

csoft.www.mk

    The www include looks for a M4 template in $(BASE)/html.m4, $(BASE)
    defaulting to ./base. The M4 template includes base.htm; additional
    M4 include files should be in $(BASE). The M4 quotes default to `{'
    and `}'. This is compatible with both BSD and GNU M4.

    This system supports flavoring -- one .html file per template may
    be generated from a single .htm, with appropriate macro expansions.
