Description

    This is a minimal makefile library, which aims at being portable
    to most make variants which support the `include' directive, as
    an alternative to horrible autoconf-generated makefiles.

    The vedge-mk library should be installed as ./mk in the top-level
    build directory, you don't need to bundle ./mk with your package.

Makefiles

    The resulting makefiles resemble BSD-style makefiles, with some
    variables and the include directive at the bottom. It processes
    directories recursively. The maptree.sh script substitutes %TOP%
    to the top-level directory, and %MK% to the directory containing
    the vedge-mk library. This is due to our inability to use the
    make -I directive, for many reasons.

vedge-www.mk

    The www library looks for a M4 template in $(BASE)/html.m4, $(BASE)
    defaulting to ./base. The M4 template includes base.htm. The files
    .htm are converted to .html, the .htm files being M4 files defining
    _TITLE_ and _CONTENT_. The quotes default to `{' and `}'.
