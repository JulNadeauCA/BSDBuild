.Sh NAME
.Nm build.lib.mk
.Nd bsdbuild - compilation of libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.lib.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module compiles static and/or shared libraries from a set of source files.
For shared libraries, it uses a bundled copy of GNU libtool.
Currently, supported languages include:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
C (*.c)
.It
C++ (*.cc)
.It
Objective C (*.m)
.It
Assembler (*.asm)
.It
Lex (*.l)
.It
Yacc (*.y)
.El
.Pp
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width "deinstall-lib "
.It Ar lib${LIB}.a
Compile the source files into a static library.
.It Ar lib${LIB}.la
Compile the source files into static and shared libraries using libtool
(libtool comes bundled with BSDBuild).
.It Ar clean-lib
Clean up object and library files.
.It Ar cleandir-lib
Clean up for packaging.
.It Ar install-lib
Install library files to the target installation directory
(see
.Xr csoft.common.mk 5 ) .
.It Ar deinstall-lib
Uninstall libraries from the installation directory.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width "CONF_OVERWRITE "
.It Ev LIB
Name of target library.
Platform-specific transforms will be applied to the name.
.It Ev LIBDIR
Target installation directory for libraries
(usually set by configure).
.It Ev LIB_INSTALL
If set to Yes, the
.Ar install
target will install the library files, otherwise it will be a no-op.
Defaults to No.
.It Ev LIB_SHARED
If set to Yes, a shared library will be built.
Default is No.
.It Ev LIB_MODULE
If set to Yes, a
.Xr dlopen 3
compatible module will be built.
Default is No.
.It Ev LIB_GUID
A Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for the library.
Exact interpretation is platform-specific.
.It Ev LIB_MAJOR
Major version number for shared libraries.
.It Ev LIB_MINOR
Minor version number for shared libraries.
.It Ev LIB_XOBJS
Extra object files to use in generating the library.
.It Ev LIBS
Other libtool-generated libraries (*.la) to include in this library.
.It Ev USE_LIBTOOL
If set to Yes, use
.Xr libtool 1
to build the libraries.
If set to No, generate the library using the traditional method involving
.Xr ar 1 ,
.Xr ranlib 1 ,
and
.Ar -fPIC .
.It Ev LIBTOOL
Path to GNU
.Xr libtool 1 .
Usually set by configure script (defaults to system libtool, or the bundled
copy).
.It Ev LIBTOOLOPTS
Specify general libtool arguments (passed before --mode).
Defaults to "--quiet".
.It Ev LIBTOOLOPTS_CC
Specify extra libtool arguments for C compilation.
Defaults to "" or "--tag=CC" depending on cc configure test results.
.It Ev LIBTOOLOPTS_CXX
Specify extra libtool arguments for C++ compilation.
Defaults to "" or "--tag=CXX" depending on cxx configure test results.
.It Ev LIBTOOLFLAGS
Specify extra compiler arguments when calling compiler from libtool
(passed after --mode).
.It Ev LTCONFIG_LOG
When using libtool, the output of the
.Pa ltconfig
script will be saved to this file.
Defaults to
.Pa ./config.log .
.It Ev CC
Compiler for C, C++ and Objective C sources.
Defaults to the CC environment variable, or "cc".
.It Ev CFLAGS
Compiler flags for C sources.
Defaults to the CFLAGS environment variable.
.It Ev CXXFLAGS
Compiler flags for C++ sources.
Defaults to the CXXFLAGS environment variable.
.It Ev OBJCFLAGS
Compiler flags for Objective C sources.
Defaults to
.Sq ${CFLAGS} .
.It Ev CPPFLAGS
Compiler preprocessor flags, for sources in all languages featuring
a C preprocessor.
.It Ev ASM
Compiler for assembler sources.
Defaults to
.Sq nasm .
.It Ev ASMFLAGS
Compiler flags for assembler.
Defaults to
.Sq -g -w-orphan-labels .
.It Ev LEX
Path to the
.Xr lex 1
lexical analyzer generator.
.It Ev YACC
Path to the
.Xr yacc 1
parser generator.
.It Ev LFLAGS
Options for
.Xr lex 1 ,
defaults to
.Sq .
.It Ev YFLAGS
Options for
.Xr yacc 1 ,
defaults to
.Sq -d .
.It Ev LIBL
Libraries to use for Lex lexers.
Defaults to
.Sq -ll .
.It Ev WINDRES
(Specific to the win32 platform)
Path to the
.Xr windres 1
utility, which generates windows resource files.
.It Ev WINRES
(Specific to the win32 platform)
Resource file to use with
.Xr windres 1 .
.It Ev DATAFILES
List of data files to install into
.Dv ${DATADIR} .
The files must have been generated from the build process (i.e., if using a
separate build with --srcdir, the specified files must exist in the build
directory).
.It Ev DATAFILES_SRC
Files to install into
.Dv ${DATADIR} .
This variable is handled similarly to
.Ev DATAFILES ,
except that the specified files must exist in the source directory.
.It Ev INCLDIR
Library header files will be installed into this directory.
See
.Xr build.common.mk 5 .
.It Ev INCL
List of library header files.
.It Ev CONFDIR

It is usually set relative to
.Sq ${SYSCONFDIR} ,
for example
.Sq ${SYSCONFDIR}/MyLibrary .
.It Ev CONF
List of configuration files to install into
.Dv ${CONFDIR}.
Note that the
