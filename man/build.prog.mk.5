.Nd bsdbuild - compilation of executables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.prog.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is used to compile an executable program from a set of source
files.
Currently, supported languages include:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
C (*.c)
.It
C++ (*.cc)
.It
Objective C (*.m)
.It
Assembler (*.asm)
.It
Lex (*.l)
.It
Yacc (*.y)
.El
.Pp
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width "deinstall-prog "
.It Ar ${PROG}
Compile/link the ${PROG} executable from the specified source files.
.It Ar ${GMONOUT}
Compile/link a profiled version of ${PROG}.
.It Ar clean-prog
Clean up object and executable files.
.It Ar cleandir-prog
Clean up for packaging.
.It Ar install-prog
Install program to the target installation directory
(see
.Xr csoft.common.mk 5 ) .
.It Ar deinstall-prog
Uninstall program from the installation directory.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width "CONF_OVERWRITE "
.It Ev PROG
Filename of target executable.
Platform-specific transforms may be applied to the name.
.It Ev PROG_TYPE
Type of application (used on some platforms by
.Xr build.proj.mk 5 ) .
Set to
.Sq CLI
for a command-line utility,
.Sq GUI
for a graphical interface and
.Sq DAEMON
for a server program.
Defaults to
.Sq CLI .
.It Ev BINDIR
Target installation directory for executables
(usually set by configure).
.It Ev PROG_INSTALL
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
the
.Ar install
target will install the program, otherwise it will be a no-op.
Defaults to
.Sq Yes .
.It Ev PROG_GUID
A Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for the program.
Exact interpretation is platform-specific.
.It Ev GMONOUT
Output filename for profiled version of the program.
.It Ev CC
Compiler for C, C++ and Objective C sources.
Defaults to
.Sq cc .
.It Ev CFLAGS
Compiler flags for C sources.
Defaults to
.Sq -O2 -g .
.It Ev CXXFLAGS
Compiler flags for C++ sources.
Defaults to
.Sq .
.It Ev OBJCFLAGS
Compiler flags for Objective C sources.
Defaults to
.Sq ${CFLAGS} .
.It Ev CPPFLAGS
Compiler preprocessor flags, for sources in all languages featuring
a C preprocessor.
.It Ev ASM
Compiler for assembler sources.
Defaults to
.Sq nasm .
.It Ev ASMFLAGS
Compiler flags for assembler.
Defaults to
.Sq -g -w-orphan-labels .
.It Ev LEX
Path to the
.Xr lex 1
lexical analyzer generator.
.It Ev YACC
Path to the
.Xr yacc 1
parser generator.
.It Ev LFLAGS
Options for
.Xr lex 1 ,
defaults to
.Sq .
.It Ev YFLAGS
Options for
.Xr yacc 1 ,
defaults to
.Sq -d .
.It Ev LIBL
Libraries to use for Lex lexers.
Defaults to
.Sq -ll .
.It Ev WINDRES
(Specific to the win32 platform)
Path to the
.Xr windres 1
utility, which generates windows resource files.
.It Ev WINRES
(Specific to the win32 platform)
Resource file to use with
.Xr windres 1 .
.It Ev DATAFILES
List of data files to install into
.Dv ${DATADIR} .
The files must have been generated from the build process (i.e., if using a
separate build with --srcdir, the specified files must exist in the build
directory).
.It Ev DATAFILES_SRC
Files to install into
.Dv ${DATADIR} .
This variable is handled similarly to
.Ev DATAFILES ,
except that the specified files must exist in the source directory.
.It Ev CONFDIR
System-wide configuration files will be installed into this directory.
It is usually set relative to
.Sq ${SYSCONFDIR} ,
for example
.Sq ${SYSCONFDIR}/MyApplication .
.It Ev CONF
List of configuration files to install into
.Dv ${CONFDIR}.
Note that the
.Ar install
target will not override existing configuration files, instead it will
output a
.Dq The following configuration files have been preserved
message.
.It Ev CONF_OVERWRITE
Overwrite any existing configuration file on installation.
Default is "No".
