.Sh NAME
.Nm mkify
.Nd BSDBuild auto-bundling script
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkify
.Ar module
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies installed BSDBuild include files from their system location
to
.Pa mk
under the working directory.
It accepts a list of BSDBuild modules as arguments (e.g.,
.Sq prog
will cause
.Xr build.prog.mk 5
to be installed).
.Nm
also scans for include directives and will automatically install all
dependencies as well.
.Pp
The BSDBuild build system is designed to be bundled with applications as
a stand-alone set of
.Xr make 1
include files, which are typically installed in a directory named
.Pa mk
in the top-level directory (or some other central location) in an
application source code, such that people building applications which
use the BSDBuild build system do not need to have BSDBuild or any
other software installed on their systems.
.Pp
While the need for a
.Pa mk
directory may be perceived as a problem, there are several advantages:
.Bl -enum
.It
Makefiles are not generated, they can be edited directly.
BSDBuild will generate Makefiles only when performing concurrent builds
(i.e., building object files in a directory separate from the source tree).
.It
BSDBuild makefiles are orders of magnitude smaller than any generated
Makefile, avoiding masses of redundant code.
.It
There is no
.Pa Makefile.in ,
so the total number of files in your tree is reduced.
